# Performance analysis of Brazilian stocks

During the pandemic, stock markets lost value around the world. However, a few months later, many have already surpassed the historical maxim. In Brazil it was no different, but I have a feeling that only the stocks that make up the Brazilian index (ibovespa / ibov) were the ones that actually went up in price. Is it true? In this analysis we will understand the composition of IBOVESPA and seek answers to the feeling I have.
